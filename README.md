## Summary

This is the progress of classifying emotions using transfer learning on Deep Convulutional Neural Network, MobileNetV2.

To the scale of the chosen datasets (FER2013 & AFF-WILD2) and the complicated task of identifying micro-expressions. I have been lucky enough to have
been given access to Kelvin2. A high performance cluster to aid in training and processing my model.

Due to legal reasons I won't be uploading the AFF-WILD2 dataset. Instead this repo will document my layering process, upload the model that has been trained & the statistics
and visualisations of my models process.

## Current Best Model
