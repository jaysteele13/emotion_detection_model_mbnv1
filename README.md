## Summary

This repo tracks the progress of **classifying emotions** using **transfer learning** on **Deep Convulutional Neural Network**, **MobileNetV1**.

This repository follows the process training and testing a multi-classification model for 7 emotions on an open source dataset known as 'FaceRec2' ().

I have been lucky enough to have been given access to **[Kelvin2](https://ni-hpc.github.io/nihpc-documentation/Connecting%20to%20Kelvin2/)**. A high performance cluster to aid in training and processing my model.

## Current Best Model
